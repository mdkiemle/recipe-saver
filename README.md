Hello!

This is a project built from an idea my fiance had. As of this writing (and I'll try to update the readme as I continue), it's essentially at its MVP version. Things function, there's a couple of features that I have plans to add (or just unlock),
and it doesn't look completely awful.

With the first release the plan is to get some feedback from her and see what else we'd like it to do. 

This was both for practice and to fulfill a need.

This project is made with electron-forge, React, TypeScript, webpack, SQLite, and TailwindCSS.

# What it does

It's a recipe book. 
The main feature is, of course, saving your recipes. As of now you can only type them in but I hope it's relatively intuitive how that works.
The other core feature is searching. This was the essential part - you can search for recipes based on their ingredients. We find that sometimes we have, say, 2 egg whites left.
What do we use these for?

Situations where you don't have a lot of your ingredient around, but you want to use it up. That's the idea. Search for the ingredient you have, come back with recipes that have it, along with the measurements.
Ideally you'd be able to always use up what you have, or maybe get just a little bit more in order to use it.
