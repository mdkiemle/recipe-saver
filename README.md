Hello!

This is a project built from an idea my fiance had. As of this writing (and I'll try to update the readme as I continue), it's essentially at its MVP version. Things function, there's a couple of features that I have plans to add (or just unlock),
and it doesn't look completely awful.

With the first release the plan is to get some feedback from her and see what else we'd like it to do. 

This was both for practice and to fulfill a need.

This project is made with electron-forge, React, TypeScript, webpack, SQLite, and TailwindCSS.
